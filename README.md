# AI-Powered Credit Fraud Detection and Prevention System

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered credit fraud detection and prevention system. The system aims to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, prevent fraudulent activities, and minimize false positives while adapting to evolving threats. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, anomaly detection, and real-time data analysis, this system intends to reduce credit fraud losses, improve detection accuracy, and enhance customer experience.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal is to develop an accurate machine learning model that can detect and prevent credit fraud transactions in real-time. Key objectives include:

* Real-time monitoring of transactions.
* Identification of suspicious patterns with high accuracy.
* Minimization of false positives.
* Leveraging machine learning models and behavioral analytics.
* Detection of anomalies and evolving fraud tactics.
* Ensuring the system is scalable and secure.
* Compliance with privacy regulations.
* Providing insights into fraud patterns through model predictions.
